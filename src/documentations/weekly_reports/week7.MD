## Weekly report 7

This week I only had time to implement some peer-review feedback. Added more clarity to readme and most importantly error-handling for too long encryption content. Additionally, extended tests to cover that.
Performed also some cleanup-duties.

I think the product is quite ready for now. Naturally, these things can be developed quite much so there is many things to improve in the future:
- Better format for saving keys.
- Better CLI.
- Padding Scheme.

However, I am quite happy about the end-result.
