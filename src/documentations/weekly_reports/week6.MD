## Weekly report 6

This week's time planning did not go well -> resulted in rush on Saturday. Managed to get Sieve implemented, which is good increment to the program.
Aim is to work on Sunday more with the application logic and making RSA-saving standardized, instead of tuple-juggling(in files).
Week was not optimal, but got important thing done so I'll take it.

Did not implement any tests for Sieve, as it is already tested through prime-generation tests. I am generally happy with my tests --> they test the flow quite well as in vertical slices.

Aim for next week is to enhance all parts of application, as now the core logic is solid and sound. Aiming to implement feedbacks based on peer-reviews.
