## Weekly report 2

This week was mainly empty due a) other busy things and b) rather good progress of last week. I have mainly iterated over the RSA-algorithm and planning next steps to be implemented. Project will see major code advancements in upcoming week, when other duties ease up and I can focus on this project more again.
