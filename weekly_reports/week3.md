## Weekly report 3

Week's goal was get the key-generation nailed down in a high-level. This was partially successful, as only last step of calculating the modular multiplicative inverse (secret private key exponent) is still to be implemented. One reason is that the deadline is on saturday, and I devote most of the time for coding on sundays. Thus, this will be probably be implemented really early on next weeks iteration, as opposed to getting it done on this deadline.

Some of the development time was spend to modularizing code and making it more structurized in general. This has lead to better development practices and easier-to-read code.

Next week, aim is to finalize key generation by filling the last step, and writing some concrete tests to verify that it works correctly.
