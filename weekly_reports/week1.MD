## Weekly raport 1

First week consisted of following:
- Creating a base for the project
- Initializing repo's and rust's systems.
- Creating v1 if prime-finding algorithm(Miller Rabin)
- Creating first part of the application which uses above and returns 2 primes

Project took good steps forward and I was prepared not to get this much progress done. I learned tons of prime-finding algorithms and how hard that problem actually is.

Next step is to move towards actual RSA-algorithm, now that prime-finding is implemented.
