## Weekly report 5

This week was super busy with other life-stuff, so did not get too much done. Dove into CLI, and reduced my weeks scope to get working CLI done, which ended up being a good target.
Cli now works, however user-experience can be enhanced. Also added Readme for easier use. Managed to make this a file-based system, so it is much nicer now.

Next week's goal is to overall polish the application and possibly enhance Miller-Rabin. Also, I try to make these files some standard format, and improve UX with error messages and better exception-handling.
