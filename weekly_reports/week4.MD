## Weekly report 4

This was a rough week but rewarding one. Managed to get Key-generation and Encryp/Decrypt flow done. Math behind all of this was definitely hardest part to comprehend, whereas understanding high-level flow and programming stuff was rather OK.
I decided to focus on getting this single pipeline to perform, and worry about details/cleanup later. Now application can successfully encrypt/decrypt strings.

Next week agenda:
- Make some sort of terminal-gui
- Make this possibly file-based.
- Output standardized RSA-keys, now this is just bunch of tuples.
- If time, implement better Miller-Rabin
