### Project Description

Project will be about implementing a RSA-encryption/decryption. Target problem to solve is encrypting and decrypting data. 

Used programming-language will be Rust.

Program will have 3 methods:
- Key generation: Receives no input, generates 1024-bit RSA-key
- Encrypt: Receives plaintext, retuns ciphertext
- Decrypt: Receives ciphertest, returns plaintext

Target time-complexity will be O(n^2)

### Core functionality

As we are implementing RSA-encryption/decryption, the core functioanality is:
- Encrypting data
- Decrypting data
- Generating RSA-keys.

Thus, the major amount of time will be used to above features. Other features such as UI and input-management will be second-class citizens.
